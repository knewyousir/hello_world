// This repo was my first repo when I first learned about Github while I was a merely learning C++.  
// Now I know a few more tricks: Python, HTML/CSS/JS, Google Apps Script and more.

// Anyways, this tool is used to copy one spreadsheet format to another one. I intended it to be able to
// be a dragged-and-dropped upon icon in the desktop. In windows, a compiled executable inherently can "receive"
// another file's icon dropped onto it in the form of command line arguments when the executable runs...
// I believe the format takes the file from ExamSoft and puts it in a format importable by Sakai gradebook.
