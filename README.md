Hello world!

My name is Knewyousir, and I am a new user of sorts.
I used to dabble in music, but these days, mostly I am learning how to code.
Someday, I hope to use my coding skills to assist in the development of crypto-currencies.
For now, I remain a bit of a dreamer, but I'm not the only one :-)
